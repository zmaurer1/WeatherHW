# WeatherHW
For this weather dashboard I utilized jquery, moment.js, ajax, json, bootstrap and the openweather API.
I set up a basic searchbot in HTML and then just used simple styling (I'm definitley not advanced in the styling). 
I set up my APPID and got my key to be able to pull data from Openweather.
